# ARXML Navigation Helper #

This extension provides easier navigation of Autosar XML files.
Also works for Autosar models split up into multiple files.

## Prerequesites ##

The language server used for resolving commands is Windows-x64 only at the moment.

For bigger files (>50MB) VSCode disables extensions. To get around this, the extension [Large file support for extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mbehr1.vsc-lfs) is needed.

## Features ##

- **Tree view**: Shows the tree structure of shortname element, in what file they are located and makes navigating easy
- **Go to definition**: Jump to the corresponding SHORT-NAME element by clicking on the corresponding path part on a REF element.
- **Go to references**: Show all REF elements that point to this SHORT-NAME element
- **Go to parent shortname**: Jump to the parent shortname element of a given reference
- **Hover information**: Shows the full path of a given shortname, and other elements its referencing. These hovers can show how many references the element contains, and links to a list of them
- **Open models split up over multiple files**: By using "open folder", all .arxml files in that folder get parsed together into one model for references, treeView, navigation etc. Every feature works across files too

## Useful Commands and Shortcuts ##

- **Ctrl + LeftClick** as a shortcut for **go to definition**
- **Alt + LeftArrow** return to your last position ("undo jump")
- **Inner parts** of REF elements can be jumped to individually (go to references works there too)
- The **Tree View** can be refreshed manually by clicking the arrow on the top right
- **Hovering** over an element in the Tree View shows you in what file the definition is located
- **References** can be set to either link directly to the reference element or the owning element in the settings

## Common issues ##

### Extension does not work on big files ###

For files bigger than around 50mb, Visual Studio Code disables all extensions automatically.
The current workaround for this is to use the VSCode extension
[Large file support for extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mbehr1.vsc-lfs).
Install it and use to command (Ctrl+Shift+P) **open large file...**
This can currently only open the file in readonly mode.

### Loading takes very long ###

Files first have to be parsed by the extension.
This takes a couple of seconds for bigger files (around 5 seconds for 170MB for me).
Afterwards jumps should be almost instant.
Things can take a while to load, especially on bigger files because VSCode needs to load in all the surrounding areas for the references, the extension itself cannot speed that up.
